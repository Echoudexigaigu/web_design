    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Haoxuan (Steve) Lin, an undergraduate at New York University majoring in Computer Science and Economics, Class of 2026. 
      I am deeply interested in the intersections of technology, data, and society, and I am currently exploring fields such as deep learning and database systems. 
      With a passion for blending computational approaches with insights from sociology and economics, I aspire to design solutions that not only advance technology but also illuminate the dynamics of human behavior and global systems.
